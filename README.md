      *	Made changes to because joining the product, category and subcategory resulted in many-to-many relationship so changed the TSQL code to avoid the many-to-many relationship and created the model with many-to-1 relationship.

  * Calculated [Total Sales], [LY Sales], [YoY Sales], [YoY Growth] for the sales trends
  * The DAX used are as follows:
  
          * i.	Total Sales = SUM(FactSales[SalesAmount])  
          * ii.	LY Sales = CALCULATE ([Total Sales], DATEADD(DimDate[Date], -1, YEAR))
          
  * Note: Can also use SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DimDate[Date]) and PREVIOUSYEAR(DimDate[Date])  functions which returned the same results.

         * iii.	YoY Sales = [Total Sales] - [LY Sales]
         * iv.	YoY Sales % = DIVIDE ([YoY Sales], [LY Sales], "-")
